            Wontta Rural Development Association (WRDA) is an indigenous local NGO established in August 1999 in the former 
            Damote Woyde District of Wolaita Zone, now within South Ethiopia. Today, WRDA implements integrated rural 
            development programs with a strong focus on food and nutrition security, livelihoods, education, health, and 
            community-led development.
          </p>

          <p>
            Despite past hardships, the communities we serve have demonstrated resilience and courage. WRDA is committed 
            to contributing meaningfully to the socio-economic advancement of these areas through community-driven 
            programs and partnerships.
          </p>

          <p>
            I extend my heartfelt appreciation to our staff, communities, local authorities, and development partners for 
            making WRDA’s achievements possible. I warmly invite all our partners—current and prospective—to continue 
            walking with WRDA toward a prosperous, resilient, and equitable Ethiopia.

            WRDA, founded in 1999, began by implementing entry-point development interventions and now practices a 
            comprehensive integrated rural development approach. “Wontta” means dawn—symbolizing hope, new beginnings, 
            and a brighter future.
          </p>

          <p>
            Over the past 25 years, WRDA has focused on food and nutrition security, livelihoods, education, health, water, 
            community organization, and women and youth empowerment. We have also strengthened grassroots institutions 
            such as SACCOs, multipurpose cooperatives, Reflect groups, and Women’s Self-Help Groups.
          </p>

          <p>
            Our programs are community-driven, ensuring that resources are used responsibly and effectively. Through 
            ABE centers and Early Childhood Education Centers, children receive quality education nurtured and supported 
            by their communities.
